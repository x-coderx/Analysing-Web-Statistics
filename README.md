# Analysing-Web-Statistics
### Problem Statement :
We have dataset (web_taffic.tsv) which contains :
- Hour
- Number of users visited our website in the given hour.

We will be predicting the hour at which we will cross 100,000 hits/hour on our website.

***100,000 hits/hour = 100,000 users visited our website in 1 hour.*

### Idea :
Idea is to use curve-fitting and Logistic Regression on our data in order to predict the hour at which we will cross 100,000 hits/hour on our website.
